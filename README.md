## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Analysis (R)
- Removed missing values and corrected data types  
- Created summary statistics:
  - Total bookings  
  - Cancellations by country, hotel type, and time of year  
  - Average lead time by hotel  
- Exported cleaned dataset for Tableau visualization  

### 2. Interactive Dashboard (Tableau)
- **Map**: cancellation rates by country  
- **Bar Chart**: cancellations by hotel type  
- **Line Chart**: bookings over time (total vs cancellations)  
- Added filters for hotel type, customer segment, and market segment  
- [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/HotelBookingTrendsDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Key Insights
- Portugal shows the highest cancellation volume, signaling a need for targeted retention strategies or deeper analysis of regional booking behavior.
- City Hotels face nearly 3Ã— more cancellations than Resort Hotels, suggesting higher churn in urban markets.
- Bookings peaked in 2016 across both hotel types, marking a high point in travel demand. The diverging trends afterward (decline in City Hotels, rise in Resort Hotels) suggest a shift toward leisure travel and changing customer preferences.

2. Run the script to clean the data and generate summary statistics  
3. Exported `cleaned_data/hotel_bookings_clean.csv` can be loaded into Tableau to recreate the dashboard
